		<h2>Summary:</h2>
		<p>In this study, I wanted to test the difference "Enhance Pointer Precision (EPP)" made on throughput according to Fitt's Law. If you are unfamiliar with the setting, EPP is a setting found in the Windows OS that alters the distance the cursor moves from mouse input based on speed. So if EPP is ON, if you move the mouse one inch to the left rapidly, and then move it back that same inch but slower, the cursor on the screen will have net moved left. If EPP is OFF, then the cursor will end up in the same location it began in as the computer now only cares about the distance the mouse moves, not the speed. This is very important in the gaming community, and most gamers, especially those that play FPS, will know to disable this setting so that they can build muscle memory.</p>
		<p>I tested three people, including myself. Each of us took the test (simplified to 10 trials each) with the EPP setting either on or off, and then a second time with the reverse setting. I made sure that we did not all begin with the same setting first as I reasoned practice on the test would make the second trial generally better. Now, without doing statistical analysis I can't comment on whether the difference is significant or not, but for all three people, regardless of order completed, average throughput was higher when EPP was set to OFF.</p>
		<p>Things I noticed that may or may not be total coincidence; I was the only gamer of the three of us, and I had significantly higher throughput than either of the other two subjects. That seems to indicate speed clicking can be learned/improved upon with practice. Furthermore, I had the biggest difference between EPP on and EPP off which again might correlate to the fact that I play computer games; I'm used to having EPP off whilst most people who use a computer still have EPP on by default.</p>
